Clone of Dwarf Fortress on Clojure.
Raw and bugged. Just an experiment.

## Usage

Please do not expect that this is a game. It was just some simple experiment of using Clojure as language for writing complex games using entity based system. And it failed from my point of view. Which is good. It proved that to write complex games you cannot use high level languages. I had fun.
